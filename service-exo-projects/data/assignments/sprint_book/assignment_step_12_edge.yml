      <p>Time to prepare for the final presentation! You will present your best ideas to the leadership next week, with the goal of eliciting more feedback and the funding you need to further develop your ExO Edge Initiatives. This week’s assignment is to have your team assemble the components of your ExO Edge Initiative to create a comprehensive presentation showcasing the amazing work you’ve done throughout the ExO Sprint.</p>

              <p>Select the most promising initiatives in advance of the final presentations. Given what you’ve learned from running the experiments, you should be able to discard some of the ExO Initiatives and focus on the two most promising options.</p>

            <p>Anticipate the evolution of your ExO Edge Initiative and define key milestones for the next 12 to 18 months. You’ll also want to estimate your budget and associate key milestones with the investment needed to reach them.</p>

              Key milestones may include:<br>- Finding the right team to execute the initiative.<br>- Running further experiments to evaluate hypotheses.<br>- Building an MVP and its later revisions.<br>- Securing first early adopters and revenues.<br>- Finding Product/ Market Fit, where the satisfaction level of most clients is high.<br>- Pursuing partnership relationships where applicable.
          - order: 2
            description: |
              For estimating revenues, create a set of business parameters that take into account the innovation accounting metrics you defined (and started experimenting with) the previous week.
          - order: 3
            description: |
              When it comes to estimating costs, be realistic about the resources and external help you will need to achieve your milestones. Milestones should align with easy-toapprove funding amounts.
          - order: 4
            description: |
              If your ExO Edge Initiative is heavily dependent on an emerging technology, your milestones may represent the interim steps that will allow you to be prepared to adopt the technology when it becomes mature enough.
          - order: 5
            description: |
              Create a sequence of manageable milestones. For example, a milestone might test the concept with a small market segment or it could test an individual component of the initiative.

            <p>In order to prepare next week’s final presentations, you must develop a deck for each of your ExO Edge Initiatives. For this round, instead of using the short elevator pitch format, you will produce longer, more comprehensive presentations for each of the ExO Initiatives. Follow the outline in the templates found later in this section.</p>

              As much as possible, use pictures instead of text for your slides to avoid the scenario of people reading your slides rather than listening to you.
          - order: 2
            description: |
              Craft a story that makes a compelling case for the initiative, beginning with the problem space and including a clear definition of the value proposition for the initiative. Is the concept easy to understand? Is its value easy to understand?
          - order: 3
            description: |
              Provide as much data as you can (i.e., MVPs, etc.). The idea is to validate your initiative.

            description: |
              Don’t worry if, for any reason, you decide to kill more than one of your current ExO Initiatives. Although you should present at least two ExO Edge Initiatives at the Launch session, you can always resurrect any of the ExO Edge Initiatives you were working on prior to the Disruption Workshop. Be sure to develop any new additions as much as you can, following the process outlined over the previous weeks. The goal is to present more evolved versions.

              Consider that you will have 15 minutes to present each initiative.

        Be creative with your presentation format. Teams may want to augment their standard presentation with sound or videos, for example.

        Add real data from the experiments to the presentations. A great performance is always a plus, but in the end it’s only a nice deck. There is always much more value in providing data and insights (quotes, for example) from actual clients to illustrate what you have learned.

      <p>Congratulations on all your work this week! This is where you will store your team's finished assignment tasks. Ideally these should be submitted by the <strong>end of the fourth day of this week</strong> unless your team has discussed a different day. This will allow your Team Coach time to review the content before your next meeting. These documents will be available for your coach to see and for your future reference.</p>
