      <p>It’s time to select and take to the next level your best ExO Core Initiatives! Next week, you will present your ExO Initiatives to a panel of disruptors (people from outside the organization who have experience either in your industry or with innovation in general) for feedback on the work you’ve done so far. This week’s main assignment is to work on the presentations for the upcoming Disruption Session, which entails a five-minute pitch for each of four initiatives. You will present to your project leadership, the other members of the ExO Sprint and to a select panel of ExO Disruptors, all of whom will provide feedback.</p>

              <p>The first task is to pick the best four ideas, which will be presented at the disruption session. In order to do that we will evaluate them according to the previous week’s results (experiments and key learnings) and the following criteria: The external disruption we are focusing on: Is it global? Did we validate it during the previous experiment? The internal reaction we are thinking of building: Does it help the organization to adapt (or to take advantage of) external industry disruption? Is it feasible (or will it be in the future due to exponentials)? Did we validate it during the previous experiment?</p>

              description: |
                If the ideas are not really ExO Core Initiatives, but closer to ExO Edge Initiatives, they can perhaps be repositioned— instead of building the initiative with an ExO Edge approach, consider defining an ExO Core Initiative that would react to the ExO Edge idea that you were thinking about (since this kind of ExO Edge Initiative may be already happening in the world). For example, if we are a hotel chain thinking to build a new online platform to offer hotel nights (which would be an ExO Edge Initiative) this idea could be transformed into a ExO Core Initiative by focusing on building the APIs that the hotel chain would need in order to connect it with the type of platform we were originally thinking about.

                To test how well your initiative helps the organization to adapt to external industry disruption, ask yourself the following: will this initiative help the organization to deal with external threats or take advantage of external opportunities due to industry disruption or context changes?

              <p>In order to ensure your organization will be set up to adopt the ExO Model and thus adapt to external disruption (based on the abundance that is being generated outside), the ExO Canvas will prompt you to think about how to leverage each of the ten ExO Attributes. Design an ExO Canvas for each of the disruption/ reaction pairs defined in the previous step. Each represents a different ExO Core Initiative. Run a brainstorming session using the blocks in the ExO Canvas as steps for the ideation process.</p>

              <p>Create a five-minute pitch and supporting presentation for each of the ExO Initiatives to be presented. At this stage of the process, (idea-stage ExO Initiatives), we recommend composing an “Elevator Pitch”, a summary of your idea that could conceivably be delivered in the time it would take for a short elevator ride. An elevator pitch is usually delivered in 60 to 90 seconds, but in this case, you’re going to a write a five-minute version. The elevator pitch should include the following items (we recommend following this order as well):</p>          
              <p><strong>MTP</strong><br>Explain why your organization exists, in order to demonstrate how your ExO Core Initiative will help it to achieve the MTP.</p>
              <p><strong>External Disruption</strong><br>Explain the problem you want to solve.</p>
              <p><strong>Internal Disruption</strong><br>Present the solution’s differentiating factors and discuss how your solution will both disrupt the industry and be scalable.</p>
              <p><strong>ExO Attributes</strong><br>Discuss the ExO Attributes you will be using the most, including those that will help you reach abundance and those that will help you to manage it.</p>

          Add real data from the executed experiments to the presentations. A great performance is always a plus, but in the end, it’s only a nice deck. There is always much more value in providing data and insights (e.g., quotes) from real clients, stakeholders or users to illustrate what you have learned.

        description: |
          If you have time, running further experiments is always a good idea. The more data you have, the better—especially in the case of any ExO Initiatives that were redeveloped during previous week after some of your hypotheses were invalidated. You now have the opportunity to run more experiments on the new ExO Initiatives (which are actually new hypotheses).

Ideally these should be submitted by the <strong>end of the fourth day of this week</strong> unless your team has discussed a different day. This will allow your Team Coach time to review the content before your next meeting. These documents will be available for your coach to see and for your future reference.</p>
