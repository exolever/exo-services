      <p>Up to now, we have been working on several ExO Edge Initiatives in order to explore as many opportunities as possible. Now, it’s time to start selecting the best ones (after the experiments we ran and the key learnings we got).</p>
      <p>Also, take into account that next week you will present your best ideas to a panel that will include disruptors (people from outside the organization who have experience either in your industry or with innovation in general) for feedback on the work you’ve done so far.</p>
      <p>So, this week’s main assignment is to work on the presentations for the upcoming Disruption Session, which entails a five-minute pitch for each of four initiatives. You will present to your project leadership, the other members of the ExO Sprint and to a select panel of ExO Disruptors, all who will provide feedback.</p>

              <p>Your first task is to pick the best four ideas to present at the disruption session. In order to do that we will evaluate them according to the previous week’s results (experiments and key learnings) and the following criteria:</p>
              <p>- The MTP: Is it really massive? Does it inspire people? Did we learn something about it during the previous experiments?<br>- The problem we are trying to solve: Is it global? Did we validate it during the previous experiment?<br>- The solution we are thinking to build: Is it scalable? Is it disruptive? Is it feasible (or will it be in the future due to exponentials)? Did we validate it during the previous experiment?</p>

                All non-selected ExO Initiatives should be filed away for possible development in the future. Also, if the initiatives are not real ExO Edge, other parts of the organization may value your research work and want to take over implementation. This can be beneficial for quelling the immune system.

You will design an ExO Canvas for each of the problem/solution pairs defined in the previous step. Each is a potential ExO! Run a brainstorming session using the blocks in the ExO Canvas as steps for the ideation process.</p>

            <p>A business model is defined as the way that an organization creates, delivers and retains value. If you have enough time, it’s a good idea to start thinking about and designing the business model for your ExO Edge Initiatives. If you can’t do it now, there will be time for this project in a few weeks.</p>
            <p>Since you are working on early-stage ExO Initiatives that will change very quickly as you learn more about them, use the Business Model Canvas to define your business model.</p>

              Start defining your customer segments with sticky notes, using a different color for each customer segment. Next, define the value proposition for each customer segment, continuing with the same color-coding. Finally, define and color-code your revenue model, making sure that you include a clear way to make money. Continue the process for the remaining canvas blocks. Use a separate color for generic items (related to the business as a whole and all customer segments)

              Defining the business model is optional at this stage, so don’t feel any pressure if time is an issue. If you can manage it, however, we recommend defining the three main blocks of the Business Model Canvas: Customer Segments, Value Proposition and Revenue Model

            <p>You will create a five-minute pitch for each of the ExO Initiatives that will be presented. You will also develop a presentation in support of each pitch. At this stage of the process (idea-stage ExO Initiatives), we recommend composing an “Elevator Pitch”—a summary of your idea that could conceivably be delivered in the time it would take for a short elevator ride. An elevator pitch is usually delivered in 60 to 90 seconds, but in this case you’re going to a write a five-minute version. The elevator pitch should include the following items (we recommend following this order too):</p>
            <p><strong>MTP</strong></p>
            <p>Explain the problem you want to solve.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
            <p>Present the solution’s differentiating factors and discuss how your solution will both disrupt the industry and be scalable.</p>
            <p><strong>ExO Attributes</strong></p>
            <p>Discuss the ExO Attributes you will be using the most, including those that will help you reach abundance and those that will help you to manage it.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Model (optional)</strong></p>
            <p>If you have had the chance to think about it, explain how you aim to generate, deliver and retain value. In other words, how you are going to make money.</p>

          Add real data from your completed experiments to the presentations. A great performance is always a plus, but in the end it’s only a nice deck. There is always much more value in providing data and insights (e.g., quotes) from actual clients or users to illustrate what you have learned

        description: |
          If you have time, running further experiments is always a good idea. The more data you have, the better— especially in the case of any ExO Initiatives that were iterated during previous week after some of your hypotheses were invalidated. You now have the opportunity to run more experiments on the new ExO Initiatives (which are actually new hypotheses).

Ideally these should be submitted by the <strong>end of the fourth day of this week</strong> unless your team has discussed a different day. This will allow your Team Coach time to review the content before your next meeting. These documents will be available for your coach to see and for your future reference.</p>
