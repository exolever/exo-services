      <p><strong>The world changes every day. Exploring how it may affect your organization is an exciting learning experience, which will surprise you!</strong></p>
      <p>Many executives spend most of their time dealing with internal issues, never looking beyond what’s happening in the organization. Don’t be one of them!</p>
      <p>The biggest threats and opportunities for your organization are found in the emergence of new technologies, business models and changes in the environment beyond your current industry.</p>
      <p>All these elements represent external disruption that may be relevant for the future of your organization in both the long- and short-term. So let’s find them!</p>
      <p>This week’s assignment sets the foundations for the Core Stream. It helps you gain a strategic overview of the most important technologies that may disrupt your industry now or in the future. How is your industry already being reshaped? By looking “outside of the building” you will gain an understanding of how your current organization needs to be reshaped, not only to survive, but also to leverage existing opportunities.</p>

              Ask yourself these questions in relation to the startups you find: What are these startups doing well or badly? Could they be potential partners, suppliers or acquisition targets? How can their best concepts be applied elsewhere? How do they solve a true customer problem? How are they thinking differently about customer needs? How are they trying to change the world? Does this inspire me about how we should try to change the world for the better?

            <p>Changes in context can be either a threat or an opportunity for your business. You need to identify those changes in order to prepare the company for disruption and generate new opportunities. You can facilitate the process of identifying potential changes in context by brainstorming about the different areas that can affect your industry or organization. Some of the potential areas:</p>
            <p><strong>Regulation:</strong> new laws, policies, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Clients:</strong> new customer segments, trends, purchase behaviors, user experiences, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Providers:</strong> new suppliers, trends, operational models, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitors:</strong> new players, substitute products/services, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Environment:</strong> new events happening in your physical or digital environment that affect your business.</p>

At this stage, you are going to describe your current organization’s business model, which will act as a framework for the ExO Initiatives. Remember that the ExO Core Stream shouldn’t change your current business model, but adapt it to external industry disruption. Use the Business Model Generation technique to describe your business model in a way that allows you to see the highlevel overview.</p>
