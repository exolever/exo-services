      <p><strong>The world changes every day. Exploring it can be an exciting learning experience—one that may even surprise you!</strong></p>
      <p>Many executives spend most of their time dealing with internal issues and never look at what’s happening beyond the organization. Don’t be one of them!</p>
      <p>The biggest opportunities can be found at the intersection of global challenges (problems that need to be solved), exponential technologies (which can solve these needs) and business models (which monetize and grow your organization).</p>
      <p>This week’s assignment sets the foundation for the Edge Stream. It helps you gain a strategic overview of the world’s greatest challenges along with the most important technologies that may disrupt your industry now or in the future. How is your industry already being reshaped?</p>
      <p>By looking “outside the building” you will gain an understanding of non-traditional and disruptive business models coming into use.</p>

              The technologies you research will be in various stages of moving into the mainstream. Some will be already in active use, while others will still be in development. Consider timing in terms of market impact, and remember that “experts” generally make forecasts based on linear projections. Don’t overlook exponential doubling patterns when they are in the early stages. They can be deceptive, since at the very beginning the exponential curve may be too flat.

Ideally these should be submitted by the <strong>end of the fourth day of this week</strong> unless your team has discussed a different day. This will allow your Team Coach time to review the content before your next meeting. These documents will be available for your coach to see and for your future reference.</p>
