      <p>Equally important is to provide the company’s leadership team with the knowledge and training to manage disruptive innovation and new Exponential Organizations.</p>
      <p>You can learn how to deal with the immune system of your company and build internal capabilities that will start to bring new life into your organization.</p>
      <p>You can start your Align journey by watching the main video and then continue by going through the 4 tasks below.</p>

              <p>The original concept behind the Exponential Organizations book was an in-depth research among the fastest growing and most succesful companies who were able to outpferform their peers at radically lower costs. They achieved these by shfting their business model from scarcity-based to abundance-based, by leveraging expoential technologies and by tapping into 11 ExO Attributes.</p>
              <p>Any company that wants to turn into an Exponential Organization needs to consider the value these attributes can bring and work towards embedding some of all of these in its operations.</p>
              <p>To begin, every ExO needs an Massive Transformation Purpose or MTP which gives its existence a deeper meaning in relation to the larger world around it. MTP describes how we would like the world to be in the future where we have succeeded as a company.</p>
              <p>Then, there are 10 other attributes - 5 outward-facing, helping us to reach 'abundance' in the market and 5 inward-facing helping to manage this abundance internally.</p>
              <p>You can learn more about these attributes by watching this task's video and exploring the resources below.</p>

            <p>A business model is the way an organizations, creates, delivers and captures value. To create a succesful and sustainable business model you will need tools that will help you rapidly pivot and iterate on all of its aspects until you find a model that works in reality.</p>
            <p>Traditional business plan is not the best suitable tool to capture highly dynamic market situations and ongoing changes in the external and internal environment of a 21st Century organization. We will use a tool called 'Business Model Canvas' to quickly visualize business models of entire organizations. You will learn more detail in this task.</p>

            <p>To be able to iterate a business model, we need to understand what works and what doesn't. Experiments are very useful to evaluate whether our beliefs are empirically valid or not. They allow us to check and analyze, with gathered data, if things are as we think or not.</p>
            <p>Get ready to understand how to design experiemts and use them to pivot and validate the hypotheses behind your brand new idea.</p>
