      <p>It’s time to take your ExO Initiatives to the next level! This week’s assignment is to formally define the assumptions underlying your ideas and prepare to test them further.</p>
      <p>Start by defining your ExO Edge Initiative business model (if you don’t have it yet) in order to build something that not only generates value but also retains it.</p>
      <p>Next, you will start build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that allows you to keep learning about your value proposition.</p>
      <p>Are you worried you won’t be able to accomplish all this in only one week? You can!</p>

              <p>A business model is defined as the way an organization creates, delivers and retains value. If you haven’t defined a business model for your ExO Edge Initiatives before, now is the time to do it. If you already have a business model, you’ll improve it now based on what you’ve learned.</p>
              <p>Since we are working on early-stage ExO Initiatives that will change quickly as you learn more about them, use the Business Model Generation technique to define your business model.</p>
              <p>Start defining your customer segments with sticky notes, using a different color for each customer segment. Next, define the value proposition for each customer segment, continuing with the same color-coding. Third, define your revenue model, keeping the color coding and making sure you define a clear way to make money. Do the same for the rest of the canvas blocks. For generic items (related to the business as a whole and all customer segments) use a different color.</p>

              <p>Another great book to help you further define a value proposition is Value Proposition Design, also by Alex Osterwalder, which includes the Value Proposition Canvas. Although not mandatory reading for this week, we think you’ll find it helpful.</p>
              <p>Another great resource to further define a product is the Product-Market Fit Canvas, which was co-created by more than 150 innovators around the world: <strong>www.productmarketfitcanvas.com</strong>. Again, this is not mandatory for this week, but it will complement your efforts.</p>

            <p>As defined by Eric Ries, an MVP is “a version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”. What that means is that, before designing and building your MVP, you should think about what you would like to learn after building and testing your MVP. Next step will be to identify the key hypotheses to evaluate at this stage, which will be those ones that are critical for the success and scale of the business. At this stage, most of the hypotheses will be found in your ExO Canvas and your Business Model Canvas:</p>
            <p><strong>ExO Attributes:</strong> whether the different ExO Attributes we have defined are the right ones or not, or even if it’s realistic to implement them.</p>
            <p><strong>Feasibility of the product:</strong> whether our product/service will actually work in the way we think it will (especially if it’s based on new technologies).</p>
            <p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> whether clients like your value proposition.</p>
            <p><strong>Revenue Model:</strong> whether clients are willing to pay for it or not.</p>

              To define the success criteria of the sales experiment, define meaningful metrics for the process. The right metrics are usually expressed as a percentage that reflects the conversion rate of potential customers from one phase to another. Example: percentage of visitors who buy the product. This is called Innovation Accounting.

            <p>You don’t need to build a full product to start learning and selling. There is no need to waste your time and money building a product that no one will want to use or pay for. Instead, experiment with an MVP. Before developing a MVP, we need to think about what the minimum set of features are that it should have at the very beginning. In order to do that, we recommend following these steps:</p>
            <p>1) Define the consumer flow using your product or service, according to the problems you detected and your defined value proposition.</p>
            <p>2) List all features that your product or service needs in order to solve your customer’s problem.</p>
            <p>3) Weight each feature by using the ICE approach, which is an acronym for the three factors that should be considered whenever priorities are set: Impact (in terms of value for the user), Cost (in terms of money) and Effort (in terms of time). Do this by giving a value between 2 and 0 to each of these factors, being 2 the most convenient value (the most impact, the less cost and the less effort) and 0 the less convenient one (the less impact, the highest cost and the highest effort).</p>
            <p>4) Prioritize the features according to their total ICE value, so we will have the features with a higher ICE, which are the ones we should include in our MVP, on the top of the list.</p>
            <p>5) Analyze the results and define what the first version of the MVP could look like according to:</p>
            <p>- The key hypotheses you need to evaluate. Remember than the main goal of this MVP is to learn so you should take this list of hypotheses into account to define your next experiment: the MVP.</p>
            <p>- The ICE prioritization and also to the key hypotheses to evaluate.</p>
            <p>- Also, sometimes you will need to add or remove features of the list for the first MVP version according to links between features (e.g. some of them may be required for the basic version due to technical reasons so you need to add it, others could be too long to develop so you may need to remove them, etc.).</p>

              Remember that your goal here is not to have the best product—or even a product that clients love— but to develop a product that allows you to learn. To that end, include learning-oriented features and add-ons that will result in further feedback.

            <p>We already have a first approach of our business model, of the product/ service and how the first MVP version of it could look like (according to the ICE prioritization of features). Now, it’s time to build our first MVP in order to try it out with potential users and learn about their feedback, which will be super valuable. There are several techniques to build MVPs, some of them focused on building an actual product and others focused on just presenting the idea to your potential clients. You will need to pick the one that works better for your product/service according to the time ahead you have. To that end, consider combining the following techniques:</p>

            <p>This is mainly for initiatives, where we have a value proposition to evaluate with potential clients. We can develop a landing page that shows and describes your MVP (you can also describe your full version of the product/service, since you won’t really need to develop it, although we recommend focusing the landing page on the key features of the MVP). Also, it allows clients to pre-order the product. You can also run an A/B test, which consists of building two different versions of the landing page with two value propositions and seeing which ones gets better acceptance of visitors.</p>
