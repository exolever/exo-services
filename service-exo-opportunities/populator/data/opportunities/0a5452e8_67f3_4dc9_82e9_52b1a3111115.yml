      Hi, how are you? Your client initiative sounds interesting and full of disruptions ;)

      I am working as a foresighter (helping companies build future scenarios, spot trends and transform them into business opportunities). Part of my job means a lot of (mega & consumer) trends scanning and analysis, so knowing latest innovations in terms of products / services / marketing campaigns / business models / exponential technologies for a given client / industry. I have done extensive scan on future of (purposeful) education.

      Having always had involvement in education - from delivering consultant training to teaching kids to code, to architecting edtech, I am passionate about projects of this nature. I'm currently implementing something similar for a Japan audience. I've also had plenty of work experience in Spain, so should be able to relate to their target customer's needs.
