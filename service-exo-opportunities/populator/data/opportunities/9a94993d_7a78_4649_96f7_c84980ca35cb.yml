  About the Client:

  2600 employees, over 50% of these are in R&D
  Revenue: â‰ˆ 30% CAGR for period 2014 - 2017

  Your role:
  We are looking for a Certified ExO Coach to work with a Core Stream Team, that consist of senior leaders as well as more junior challengers.
  You have significant experience from working within similar size and type of businesses in leadership or consulting roles, leading change programs.
  You will be in the role of challenging the current thinking of the team members and the team.

  The team will be more self-guided by use of the Exponential Transformation book and our online content than Sprint teams have been in the past.
  Your weekly contribution is therefore estimated to approx 4 hours per week but we ask for your flexibility around this estimate given that we use this Sprint to improve the scope of work of the ExO Coach based our learning from previous Sprints.
