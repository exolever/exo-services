        <strong>Your project will be ending and closing today. Please leave your feedback about {{applicant_name}}'s work.</strong>
    </mj-text>
    <mj-text>
    You have 7 days to leave your feedback. The system is double-blind, which means that the feedback wonâ€™t be visible until both parties provide it for each other. If you think this project requires more time, you can extend the deadline so that you and {{applicant_name}} can keep working on it.
