  <p>Today is the big day, today the book Exponential Transformation is finally released!</p>

  <p>Thank you again for all of your contributions during the process of writing this book. I can't express my gratitude enough to all of you for having been so supportive during the process of writing the book.</p>

  <p>However, the book’s purpose doesn't end with publication. We really want to establish the ExO Sprint methodology as the standard for business transformation globally. We think we can do it, and we need your help.</p>

  <p>In this group, we’ll be having discussions around the ExO Sprint methodology itself and how to spread it all around the world. We want to support each other in doing activities related to the book (such as running ExO Workshops) and to keep building a global ExO Movement.</p>

  <p>So I'd like to kickoff this Exponential Transformation book collaborator community by asking all of you the following question.</p>

  <p>As a book collaborator, what would you expect out of this community?</p>

  <p>Looking forward to an exponential community,</p>

  <p>Naina</p>
