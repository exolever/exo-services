  <p>Hello ExO Coaches and ExO Head Coaches,</p>

  <p>Welcome to your new Coaches Circle! This is a private forum for past and present ExO Coaches and ExO Head Coaches to explore, discuss and learn best practices from each other.</p>

  <p>We also want to take this opportunity to recommend two videos located in the Media Library that can help you understand what Head Coaches and Coaches do.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is an ExO Sprint Head Coach?</li>
    <li>What is an ExO Sprint Coach?</li>
