      <p>Self-tapping screws drill their own holes when they’re screwed into materials such as wood, plastic and metal. By using a screwdriver to attach a self-tapping screw, you can create precisely fitted threads. They're ideal for combining two different types of materials or for screwing in areas where access is only one-sided. It’s helpful to use self-tapping screws for products that need to be maintained regularly, such as air-conditioning units or canopies, where you need to dissemble and reassemble the item along the same threads.</p>

      <p>The two types of self-tapping screws are thread-forming and thread-cutting. Thread-forming screws are meant for plastic, deforming the material as the screw enters. Although thread-forming screws remain in the material more tightly, there is a risk of over-tightening the screw, which could cause the material to break under pressure. On the other hand, thread-cutting screws are typically used for wood and metal, literally removing some of the material and creating a threaded path for the screw. The drawback of thread-cutting screws is that the threads may strip when disassembling the fastener. If that happens, make sure to use a slightly larger self-tapping screw when reassembling the product.</p>
