      <ul>
      <li>connected</li>
      <li>autonomous</li>
      <li>lightweight</li>
      <li>self aware (predictive maintenance and self-healing)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>The question is …are we going to see a personalization in this industry as in many others? it seems that cost drops and digital orchestration would support this in the long run…</p>
