  <p>Will the <strong>automotive/EV industry</strong> produce more cars in <em>10 years</em> or less? (Units)</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Or will trends like autonomous driving and the rise of on demand mobility <strong>reduce the need for as many cars as today</strong>?</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>What about goods and human transport drones? Any market figures on that?</p>

      <p>My expectation is the number will go up due to developing economies building better roads and therefore more cars can be supported. In developed countries, there will a gradual switch from standard to autonomous cars, but they won't be supported everywhere so...</p>
      <p>Elon Musk actually said in an interview once that autonomous cars will make traffic worse initially as they try to figure out/optimize the trip algorithms (a la Uber)</p>

      <p>I agree with Gorka.</p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Global demand is going up, mostly driven by China and India, where we are seeing the rapid emergence of cars as a service model (eg Uber, Didi, etc) which temporarily makes cars accessible on demand for a part of the population that can not afford to buy a car themselves.</p>
      <p>EV and autonomous cars may take over but for the next ten years o would expect growth and a massive replacement cycle before the benefits of autonomous kicks in (medium to long term collapse down to 10-20pct of current fleet)</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the full report is a paid report, but the summary provides some <em>useful information</em>.</p>

      <p>The trend is growth, and by more than a little bit!<p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Over <strong>70 million</strong> last year.</p>
