      <p>Thank you for reaching out to us here again. The obtainable market you can calculate reasonable assumptions about the development of the company you are building. This means the obtainable market does not stay at all times the same. What is the reasonable growth rate of customers you can get and the average revenue generated by each in 6 months and how about in 2 years. I am happy to help you craft the model and assumptions for your business if you need to. If you are interested, please file a request on OpenExO through an advisor ticket. Have a good one and I hope this helps. Luciana</p>
