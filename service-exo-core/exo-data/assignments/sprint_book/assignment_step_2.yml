      <p><strong>Awake—are you looking closely enough!</strong></p>
      <p>It is time to awake your organization and realize how fast things are changing around you, at a pace never seen before. Exponential technologies generate abundance in everything and traditinal busines models based on scarcity are becaming obsolete, urging companies to evolve if they want to participate in the new upcoming world.</p>
      <p>However, organizations are protected from change by their 'immune system' which often ends up attacking innovation and any signs of what is possible in the future.</p>
      <p>By following this Awake assignment, you will be abe to better understand the past, present and future of exponential technologies and their potential for the future of humanity. You will hear Salim Ismail give many examples of disruption and exponential changes in the world around us and understand better how Exponential Organizations can thrive in this new world where traditional organizations often can't cope.</p>
      <p>You will be able to understand the difference between linear vs. exponential thinking and what your organization can do to adapt to the rapidly changing world of today.</p>

      <p>Congratulations on all your work this week! This is where you will store your team's finished assignment tasks. Ideally these should be submitted by the <strong>end of the fourth day of this week</strong> unless your team has discussed a different day. This will allow your Team Coach time to review the content before your next meeting. These documents will be available for your coach to see and for your future reference.</p>
