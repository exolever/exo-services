      <p>There are prize funds at stake during each phase of the SOLVE stage of the Fastrack. You will be evaluated objectively and subjectively on the evaluation criteria listed above. A combination of the Fastrack Curator and Co-Curator, Regional Advisory Board, FTI Board, FTI Core Team, members of the regional community, ExO ecosystem members and invited experts will be the evaluators. In the case of a tie, a small tie breaker committee will be convened to make the final decision.</p>
