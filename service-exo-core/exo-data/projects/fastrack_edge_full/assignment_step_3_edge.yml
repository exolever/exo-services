      <p>You will be evaluated objectively and subjectively on the criteria listed above. There are prizes funds at stake as well. A combination of the regional curator, regional advisory board, FTI Board and select members of the Regional Development Community and Global Member Organization representatives will be the evaluators. They will judge your work and complete scorecards that will be a major part of the selection​ ​process. In the case of any ties, as seems to happen sometimes, a small tie breaker committee including the regional curator and 2 other qualified, non-participating but well informed, people of their choice will be convened​ ​to​ ​make​ ​the​ ​final​ ​decision.</p>
